# Description

  This is a fully functioning progressive web application which serves as a text editor. The text editor will cache the information typed into it as discrete indexedDB items in application storage. These can be accessed at any time whether the user is online or offline. The application uses the webpack npm package to accomplish this and uses service workers and a manifest install to serve assets to the end user.
